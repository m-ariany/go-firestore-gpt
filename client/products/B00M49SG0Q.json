After about 20mins it fades and can only be smelled at very,very close range ,like a inch or so from beard. Overall its good for eliminating bearddruff,beard itch, and dry skin. I do however recommend , using 100% pure argan oil along with it , to help it spread better. A few squirts of argan, and 4-5 drops of honest amish classic oil ,that amount will do your beard, your face and head. It has properties that strengthen hair follicles, this includes beard ,and head hair alike, also moisturizes skin. No greasy oil left behind, it absorbs within a minute or 2.Info comes via Cates Husband. :-) see less.",

            "Comment": "The dropper supplied with bottle takes a moment to get used to and the product spreads generously, so use less to make it last. Been using about 30 days an skin is softer and have noticed additional beard growth as well. Would prefer a different type of bottle but the product itself works well. Does not have a strong smell just enough..",

            "Comment": "Love their gritty beard wax. Best product ever. But this oil….only on second use. Somewhat softer and hydrated my beard, but not sure I can stomach the scent. As others said, it does have a bad black licorice smell. Hate it. Lingers. Not sure it’s worth dealing with that..",
